## Drill
1. Get an empty *Simple_window* with the size 600 by 400 and a label *My window* compiled, linked, and run.
1. Now add the examples from §12.7 one by one, testing between each added subsection example.
1. Go through and make one minor change (e.g., in color, in location, or in number of points) to each of the subsection examples.

## Exercise 01
1. Draw a rectangle as a Rectangle and as a Polygon. Make the lines of the Polygon red and the lines of the Rectangle blue.

## Exercise 02
1. Draw a 100-by-30 Rectangle and place the text “Howdy!” inside it.

## Exercise 03
1. Draw your initials 150 pixels high. 
1. Use a thick line. 
1. Draw each initial in a different color.

## Exercise 04
1. Draw a 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe board of alternating white and red squares.

## Exercise 05
1. Draw a red 1/4-inch frame around a rectangle that is three-quarters the height of your screen and two-thirds the width.

## Exercise 06
1. What happens when you draw a Shape that doesn’t fit inside its window?
1. What happens when you draw a Window that doesn’t fit on your screen?
1. Write two programs that illustrate these two phenomena.

## Exercise 07
1. Draw a two-dimensional house seen from the front, the way a child would: with a door, two windows, and a roof with a chimney.
1. Feel free to add details; maybe have “smoke” come out of the chimney.

## Exercise 08
1. Draw the Olympic five rings.
1. If you can’t remember the colors, look them up.

## Exercise 09

1. Label the image both with a title on the window and with a caption in the window. 

## Exercise 10
1. Draw the file diagram from §12.8.

## Exercise 11
1. Draw a series of regular polygons, one inside the other.
1. The innermost should be an equilateral triangle, enclosed by a square, enclosed by a pentagon, etc.
1. For the mathematically adept only: let all the points of each N-polygon touch sides of the (N+1)-polygon.
1. Hint: The trigonometric functions are found in <cmath>.

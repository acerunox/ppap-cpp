/*
Exercise 02: Write a program that creates a file of data in the form of the temperature Reading type defined in §10.5.
             For testing, fill the file with at least 50 “temperature readings.”
             Call this program store_temps.cpp and the file it creates raw_temps.txt.

Exercise 03: Write a program that reads the data from raw_temps.txt created in exercise 2 into a vector and then calculates the mean and median temperatures in your data set.
             Call this program temp_stats.cpp.

Exercise 04: Modify the store_temps.cpp program from exercise 2 to include a temperature suffix c for Celsius or f for Fahrenheit temperatures.
             Then modify the temp_stats.cpp program to test each temperature, converting the Celsius readings to Fahrenheit before putting them into the vector.

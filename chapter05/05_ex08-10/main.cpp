/*
Exercise 08: Write a program that reads and stores a series of integers and then computes the sum of the first N integers. 
             First ask for N, then read the values into a vector, then calculate the sum of the first N values.

Exercise 09: Modify the program from exercise 8 to write out an error if the result cannot be represented as an int.

Exercise 10: Modify the program from exercise 8 to use double instead of int. 
             Also, make a vector of doubles containing the Nâ€“1 differences between adjacent values and write out that vector of differences.

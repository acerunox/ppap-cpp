# Exercises from "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++"

<p align="justify">This repository contains exercises that I have done from the book <b>Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (2014)</b> by Bjarne Stroustrup. All of them were done on Manjaro Linux with Visual Studio Code, however there is also a similar repository, but using Windows 10 with Visual Studio Community 2019, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/acerunox/ppap-cpp-vs">here</a>.</p>
